# OL Engineering Program


## What is Iqlusion?


Iqlusion is a blockchain infrastructure company that has been building and operating infrastructure. We were one of the first Proof of Stake validator companies. We are currently primarily focused on protocol development.

## The Iqlusion engineering program


Iqlusion intends to supervise the evolution and extension of 0L blockchain from it’s current nascent form into a full feature base layer in the multichain world.

We intend to establish a mature engineering program around 0L with design documents, ADR, pull requests and code review to ensure a stable and robust blockchain platform. 

Of particular interest to us is developing an engineering program to connect 0L to the Internet of Blockchains via support for Ethereum and IBC interoperability.
